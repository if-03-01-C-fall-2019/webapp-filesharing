1) Summary:

Our web-app should allow people to share and/or store their files online.
There should also be a login system so you can share your files just with your friends

2) Tasks to do:
create a login system (maybe with email verification)
send files to specific accounts
a public "chat" where everyone can upload their files (with searchbar and filters)

3) issues:
to prevent a data overflow, files get deleted after a week
store the access data and files securely
prevent not suitable posts from uploading
send automaticly generated emails
