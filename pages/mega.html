      		<p>Motto: The Privacy Company</p>
      		<p>Mega (Recursive acronym for Mega Encrypted Global Access) was realised in August 2013. Originally developed by Kim Dotcom whho sold the website in 2015. <br>
        	the idea was to make a website that can encrypt your data as good as possible. Now Mega has more than 100 milion <br>
        	active users and a gain of 263 million US-Dollars per year.</p>
        	<p>Fun fact: if you find a coding mistake, you will get round about 10.000 US-Dollars.<br><br>
